Scroll Config:
File names should be "reforged_server_event.txt" and "reforged_server_info.txt". NOTE. Remove TODO if using the template and it should be correct.
The first line of the text file is the title for the scroll.
The scrolls support 3 types of links: steam workshop, youtube channel, and discord invites. To set a link you state the type and the id. You DO NOT give the full link.
EX:
steam:workshop_id
discord:invite_link_id
youtube:channel_name

Example text file contents:
ReForged Server
This is my ReForged server.
